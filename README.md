## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have installed the following prerequisites on your host machine:
* containerd
* podman

The build container expects the run user's primary group to be 4040 in order
to accomplish write access for mapped directories (DL_DIR and SSTATE_DIR)
to outlive container termination.
Therefore, change your run user's primary group accordingly:
```sh
sudo usermod -g 4040 $(whoami)
```
Though, you will be better equipped to create a dedicated run user with
primary group id set to 4040, e.g.:
```sh
sudo useradd yocto -g 4040
```

## Bootstrapping the Yocto Build Container

Run the following commands to set up the build container environment:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jhnc-oss/yocto-build.git
$ cd yocto-build
$ ./dev/bootstrap.sh

  â€” or:
$ ./dev/bootstrap.sh <manifest branch>
```

Layer manifest `main` is used by default, use `dev/bootstrap.sh <Manifest Branch>` to select another one.

## Known Issues

There are known issues running the build container on systems with enabled SELinux in Enforcing mode. If you get permission errors try to set SELinux mode to permissive by running:
```sh
sudo setenforce 0
```

You may face further issues with SELinux being enabled during builds resulting in
errors such as:
```sh
Command 'cp -afl --preserve=xattr ...' failed
```

As the podman container runs unprivileged (rootless) the cause might be
container-storage setting driver to "overlay" by default.
Try  switching to "vfs" using the following user-specific configuration
snippet:
```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/containers
cat > ~/.config/containers/storage.conf <<EOF
[storage]
driver = "vfs"
EOF
```

After changing the driver setting when running podman you may face errors such as:
```
ERRO[0000] User-selected graph driver "vfs" overwritten by graph driver "overlay" from database - delete libpod local files to resolve
```

In this case, you have to reset your database, e.g. by running:
```sh
(sudo) rm -rf ~/.local/share/containers
```

For further details please refer to containers-storage.conf(5).

## Building and running the SDK (currently limited to milestone 17)

Start with bootstrapping the container as usual:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jhnc-oss/yocto-build.git
$ cd yocto-build
$ ./dev/bootstrap.sh <milestone>
```

Build and populate the SDK by running:
```sh
$ bitbake protos-core-image-dev -c populate_sdk
```

The resulting SDK, which in our case is a SDK installer for a 64-bit development host system
(Fedora Core >= 34 recommended) and a i586-tuned target architecture should be copied to the
development host system:
```sh
$ ls tmp/deploy/sdk/tmp/deploy/sdk/protos-glibc-x86_64-protos-core-image-dev-i586-genericx86-toolchain-3.1.17.sh
```

Install the SDK on your development host system by running the self-extracting shell scripts:
```sh
$ ~/Downloads/sdk/protos-glibc-x86_64-protos-core-image-dev-i586-genericx86-toolchain-3.1.17.sh
XXX Output from script goes here XXX
XXX Output from script goes here XXX
XXX Output from script goes here XXX
XXX Output from script goes here XXX
XXX Output from script goes here XXX
XXX Output from script goes here XXX
XXX Output from script goes here XXX
```

Once the SDK has been installed you must run SDK's setup script
```sh
source /opt/<path>/<to>/<env-setup-script>
```

## Using the SDK to compile an application (xeyes example goes here):
Start with bootstrapping the container as usual:
```sh
XXX add steps to build xeyes from source using SDK XXX
```
